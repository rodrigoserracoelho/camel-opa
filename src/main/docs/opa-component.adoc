The OPA component allows you to perform authorization checks against an
Open Policy Agent with a given input. +

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-opa</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------------
opa:host[?options]
-----------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options


// component options: START
The OPA component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The OPA endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
opa:host
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *endpoint* | *Required* Name of either a javax.naming.directory.DirContext, or java.util.Hashtable, or Map bean to lookup in the registry. If the bean is either a Hashtable or Map then a new javax.naming.directory.DirContext instance is created for each use. If the bean is a javax.naming.directory.DirContext then the bean is used as given. The latter may not be possible in all situations where the javax.naming.directory.DirContext must not be shared, and in those situations it can be better to use java.util.Hashtable or Map instead. |  | String
